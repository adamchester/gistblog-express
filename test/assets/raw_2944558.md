This blog exists purely a learning experience.

As you may notice, the blog posts are actually github gists (http://gist.github.com/). It is based on [gistblog](http://github.com/liammclennan/gistblog) (see http://withouttheloop.com/).

I am currently looking for a way to correctly render the github markdown (with full embedded syntax highlighting, etc).

The software behind this site utilises technologies including:
<ul>
<li>JavaScript/Node.JS - http://nodejs.org/</li>
<li>Express (NodeJS web framework) - http://expressjs.com/</li>
<li>Azure (Hosting/Deployment) - http://azure.com/</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</li>
</ul>
