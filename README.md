Gistblog-express
================

Gistblog-express is based on [gistblog](https://github.com/liammclennan/gistblog), but uses expressjs instead of geddy, primarily so it would be easily deployed on the [azure](http://windowsazure.com) platform.

To run:

1. install [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)

1. run the 'npm install' command

```cli
    npm install
```    

1. start gistblog-express

```
    node app
```
